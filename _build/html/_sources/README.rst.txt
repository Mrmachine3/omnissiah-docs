Omnissiah Security Platform
***************************

Omnimon Security Platform is an industry leading security platform enabling various organizations to orchestrate hybrid cloud and on-premise assets purposely deployed to collect and process all types of machine data to proactively response to threats. The platform is a collection of free and open source solutions intended to integrate typical processes and tools used in modern security operations centers (SOC). The objective of the project is to document a holistic security solution that integrates the components of the following open source projects to create an all-in-one SOC environment:

- Elastic stack - log data storage and indexing
  - Elasticsearch - search and index engine
  - Logstash - data consumers and processors
  - Kafka - data queueing and streaming
  - Kibana - frontend search application
  - Beats - data shippers

- **[The Hive](https://thehive-project.org/)** - a scalable security incident response platform, tightly integrated with MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) threat intelligence feeds, designed to make analysis and incident response easier for SOCs and any information practitioner dealing with security incidents that need to be investigated and acted upon swiftly.

- Zeek - a network security intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) that enables threat hunters, security analysts and SIEM engineers the ability to monitor their environments, identify threats, improve alert mechanisms and gain more visibility into enterprise environments by gathering endpoint, network, and infrastructure logs. 

- **[Moloch](https://molo.ch/)** - an indexed packet capture and search tool that enables users to search network artifacts directly within Moloch's packet capture indexes to identify communication patterns occurring in enterprise networks.

- CyberChef - 

This code repository is intended to store enterprise-scale artifacts that describe models in which to design, develop, deploy, orchestrate, and operate a hybrid, multi-site, cloud and on-premise data center. The objective of Omnimon Secrity Operations a.k.a project OSO, is to automate the deployment of virtual assets and containerized workloads that will enable security monitoring services. These services enable security operation teams the ability to triage and respond to near real-time alert data available through data ingestion and parsing processes.
